- 👋 Hi, I’m @avshytov
- 👀 I am a condensed-matter physicist working on theory of quantum transport in nanoscale systems, such as graphene. Currently, I am affiliated with the University of Exeter
- 🌱 Currently, I work on e-fluids, i.e. fluids formed by electrons. I am trying to understand flow of charge in such systems. 
- 💞️ I am interested in collaborations on these topics, as well as other topics related to quantum transport theory. 
- 📫 You can reach me by email at A.Shytov@exeter.ac.uk
